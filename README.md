#WDN MAINTENANCE POLICY

Welcome to the official repository of the WDN MAINTENANCE POLICY Software, a web application for planning the maintenance of water distribution systems subject to shocks and natural degradation. This application has been developed by Oscar J. R. Correa, Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante, Emmanuel O. Adele, Augusto J. S. Rodrigues and Yan R. Melo.

This tool was designed for broad accessibility in the industry, eliminating the need for extensive knowledge of mathematical modeling or programming languages.
